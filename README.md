# LinguaNabanga

LinguaNabanga is a web app for building and browsing multilingual, project-based dictionaries. It loads structured data from JSON, supports Markdown content, multimedia, and offers fast text search with configurable fuzziness. It works offline (PWA) and supports flexible data types and presentation, including images and audio.

LinguaNabanga is free and open-access. Once downloaded, it can be used offline without an internet connection.

It provides multi-access filters and search tools to narrow or find entries, through free-text queries or defined categories. Fuzzy search helps deal with non-standardized orthographies.

## Data format
Data format: content lives in a simple Excel spreadsheet (XLSX), which allows you to define any type of data or structure you wish to capture in your dictionary; and a plain folder structure for media. You can compile them into a single data.json with the built-in importer.
